# Hipparcos_Exploraatory_Analysis_and_Classification
This project takes a look at the Hipparcos Dataset which catalogues the position and other relevant information for more than one hundred thousand stars. Exploratory data analysis were performed after which several classification models were created. Neural networks were also employed in the classification task.
